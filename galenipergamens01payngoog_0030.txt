that he prepared himself for the sacred office by entering, in
mature life, upon the study of ffleology, and a curious story is

petulance. Cheke seems to argue that it shewed some scepti-
cism in Linacre or want of respect sor the Scriptures. Selden
has misunderstood the story still more strangely, imagining
