INTRODUCTION. 27

We do not know whether Linacre's influence was in any
way concerned in getting this Statute passed. A·sew years
afterwards, in the year 1518, Royal letters patent were granted
for. the carrying out os the scheme in which Linacre was eon-
cerned and which was in all probability sramed by him. The
letters were addressed to John Chambre, Thomas Linacre,
and Fernandus de Victoria, to ether with three other physicians
also named, and all men oi the same faculty in London.
These were to be incorporated as one perpetual commonalty
or College, to have the power os electing a President, the use
osa common seal, the liberty os holding lands in see and of
purchasing lands whose annual value did not exceed A 12.
They were permitted to make statutes for regulating the
practice of physic in London and sor seven miles round,'and
received the important privilege os punishing offenders by fine
01· lsshlelssgllefftleeri‘ss were dated 23rd September ⁴in⁴ the loth year
of Henry VIlI. Four years after the privileges thereby
granted were confirmed and extended hy a Statute (14 & ῐ 5
Henry V111. Cap. 5). By this statute the privileges os the
Collega were extended over the whole of England, no person
bein allowed to practise physic without having been examinet!
and icensed by the President os the Collega and three of the
eleet. The reason given for this extension os privilege was
the difficulty os finding in each diocese men able to sufficient-ly
examine those who were to be admitted physicians. The
graduates of Oxsord or Cambridge who had accomplished all
their exercises in due form without an grace were alone
allowed to practise without a licence. he privileges os the
College were confirmed and enlarged by several subsequent
Statutes and Letters Patent in the reign os King ames the
First, in the Protectorate of Cromwell, and at o er times.
