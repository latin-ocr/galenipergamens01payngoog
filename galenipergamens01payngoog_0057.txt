Bodleian Librasy. But an examination of this copy ⁷ has
eonvinced me that it is of the same edition, though an error
in the tinting of the last six leaves makes it appear different
Acco 'ng to the Bn'tish Museum Catalogue a second edition
in ηιμ-[ιο. was printed at London in 1527. The version was
frequently reprinted on the continent, either alone or as a part
os the collected Latin editions of Galeu's works ι but no sub-
sequent edition has appeared in this country.
