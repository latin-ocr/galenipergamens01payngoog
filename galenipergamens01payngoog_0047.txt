36 INTRODUCTION.

hipz but the operation undertaken against Linacre’s advice,
unfortunately proved fatal.

It was not Linacre's fortune to contribute anything to the
science os medicine, or to any os its collateral sciencee. His
age was not one os research as now understood. The sust
original work on medicine produced in England was done by
his successor Caius, whose treatise on the sweating sickness
published twenty years aster Linacre's dmth is still esteemed.
This and other great epidemics must have passed before the
eyes os Linacre, but no record remains to shew us in what
light he ιεέ-πάεά them. Nor is there an evidence that he
apprecizte the importance os the reviv of Anatomy and
Botany; sciences on which the subsequent development of
medicine in Europe has so largely been based. Though
evidently e erly desirous to assist in the renovat-ion of medical
science, heaqooked to other means to accomplish this end.
What these means were it may be worth while to state some-
what rnore in demil.

The aim which Linacre and other scholars set before them
in translaring or publishing the works of Galen can only be
understood by a consideration os the state os medical learning
and scholarship at the time. The student os medicine in those
days, like the student of theolog-y or philosophy, had to derive
his knowledge almost entirely from books. There was indeed
one school os practical anatomy in Italy, that founded by
Mundinus at Bologna in the 14th century, and continued in
Linacre’s time by Berengasius Carpus, who is said to have
dissected one hundred bodies with his own hand, but in other
parts os Europe only a literary knowledge os anatomy was
