It will hardly be necessary ω supplement the terse
eulogium pronounced by Caius, by any attempt to sum up
Linacre’s molal excellencee But it may be worth while to
form some estimate os the talents and accomplishments which

ave him so high a reputation among his contemporaries
{Io original wxiting of Linaere's has been preserved, except
bis grammatieal works and a few dedications and letters, on
the strength os which it would be absurd to hazard any gene-
mlization as to his intellectual power. His reputation tested

them we should gather that it was to the multifariousness os
Linzcre's attainments as well as his excellence in each, that he

testimonies. His Latin writing was thought to be so good
that according to the friendly eulogium of Erasmus, the
works os Galen as interpreted by Linacre, spoke better
Latin than they had before spoken Greek Other opinions
not less laudatory were expressed both by Erasmus himself in
other places and by other scholars not less sensitive in the
matter of style. Lmacre was not, however, a slavish imitator
os any master. Erasmus among others has preserved the

many cases ultimately lustu. It is disappointing to hear that
Linacre had translated Aristotle in such a way that Erasmus
