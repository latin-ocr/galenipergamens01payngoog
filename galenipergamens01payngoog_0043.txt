³2 INTRODUCTJON

College or Hall might he appointed. The appointment was
for three years only. With our present experience of Uni-
versity history, it is easy to see that no system could have
been better calculated to reduce Linaere's great foundation
to uselessness and obseurity.

The names os a few us the earlier readers are given by
Wood; that os one only, Dr Robert Barnes, emerges from

their stipends were regarded as nothing more than an agree-

by Merton Coilege, as an equivalent sor the income which the

given to St John’s College, and though it was at first pro-
vided that the lectures os Linacre's Reader should be de-

originally settled by Linacre for one which has turned out
to be os less value, the income originally intended sor the
Readership seems to have been lost. But sor the sake os
other than Cambridge men it ought to be here stated that
the present Linacre Reader of Pathology fills with credit a
chair most inadequately endowed, and has revived in Cam-
