Rome, where his studies in the Vatican library procured him
the acquaintance os another grmt scholas, Hermolaus Barba-
rus. It is possible that this acquaintance may have given
Limcre’s studies a bias in the direction of medicine; sor Bar-
barus, though not a physician, had devoted himself specially
to the study os Dioscorides, whose works he translated into
Latin, and illustrated with commentaries, more than once re-

there advocated. Barbarus was also a great Aristotelian
scholar, and in this direction also he may have influenced the
mind of Linacre; who afterwards undertook and partly car-
ried out a plan which had also been among the projeens of the
elder scholar, os a complete translation os the works of Aris-

rnolaus Barbarus seems traceable, and is Linacre took as his
model in a learned lise any of the great scholars with whom
he studied, it was certainly rather Hermolaus than any
other.

From Rome Linacre went to Venice, and here made the
valuable acquaintance os the great printer, Aldus Manutius
Romanus, who was then engaged in bringing out some of the
most important editions os the classies, by which he earned
the gmtitude of scholare.. Aldus appears to have treated the
English scholar with great kindness, which is acknowledged,
as a personal favour, by William Grocyn, in a letter to Aldus,
which must have been written shortly after Linacre¹s re-
turn from Italy. After acknowledging the kindness shewn
