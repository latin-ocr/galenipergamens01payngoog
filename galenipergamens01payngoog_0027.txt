16 INTRODUCTION.

Colet was at F lorenoe during the ‘tation and enthusiasm
aroused by the preaching os Savonaro a, and doubtless derived
from him that new spirit in theology which his aster lise dis-
played‚ and which has caused him to be reckoned among the
precursors of the reformation. Grocyn and Linacre shew
nothing of this. They knew Florence when the literary re-
nairsance was at its height. and when the spirit of the learned
world was more paga-n than Christian. We shall notice aster-

desei-red, in order that he might visit England with the same
object. The story os Erasmus' stay in Oxsord has osten been
told, though never before so fully and clearly as in Mr See-
bohm's volume already referred to. It is very likely that he
may have derived from Colet some οἱ the idms which aster-

Linacre he owed, undoubtedly, the foundation os his Greek
scholasship, and his respect for the ability and character os his
teacher are shewn in many well-known passages from his
letters, In one os the best known he writes as follows: “In
