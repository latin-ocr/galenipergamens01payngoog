acquired the Prebend of South Newbold in the Cathedral of

&fffflsszflfflssafflffi‘sffiss‘ssffssffg ἓξὲξ ⁵23? γὲῒοεέἷιῗὲἑ
benefices are recorded as having been bels'tnwed upon him,
·the Rectory os Holworthy in Devonshire by the King, in
1518, and in 1520 the Rectory of Wigan, in Lancashire‚ on
the title os which he received riest's orders, Dec. 22, 1520,
and which he held till his death ¹.

There is no evidence that Linacre resided at any one
os the benefices or Cathedral appointments which he received.
In fact it is must robable, though not absolutely certain„ that
he continued to ive in his London house. His biographers
then have been somewhat puzzled to account for his accepting·
so many preferments and resigning most os them so soon.
But it is probable that a physician and scholar did not hold
more rigid notions respecting the evils os pluralism than his
more strictly clerical contemporaries and that he saw no harm
in holding a benefice os which he could not discharge the duty
or only did so by deputy; The speedy resignation of a bene-
fice is no evidence that the preferment was unprofimble. It
is probable that in accordance with the common custom he
resigned only in favour of a consideration paid by an aspirant
who desired to be presented to the office, and was willing
to pay the holder to vacate it Such a practice has lasted
in reg-ard to secular offices almost to our own time12.
Linacre must be judged not b the system which, what-
ever its saults. gave him leisure or literaryr work and plans
os public usefulness‚ but by the manner in which he employed
the wealth which these benefices placed at his disposal. It
must have been from this source that he obtained sunds for
his munificent endowments.
