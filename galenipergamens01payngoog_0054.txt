a writer far more unsystematic, ancl free from the vice of
formalism, whose sagacity and power of observation give his
works 3 perennial freshneSS. .Finally, the revival os the ancient
claesics led to the revival also os the sciences on which modern
medicine rests, and which were destined to overthrow all the
dogmatic systems¹ viz Anatomy and the knowledge of Drugs.

Haller, speaking os the progress of anatomy in the 16th
century. attributes it to two chief causes, the revival of the
works of Galen, and the invention of printing. Not less did
Botany and Pharmacology take a. new departure from the
works of Dioscorides. It would thus appffls that the task
of Linacre and the scholars, really though not in appearance,
contributed to the scientiae movement which was the turning-
point in modern medicine. This movement was the special
work of the 16th century. The time had not yet come for

the reform in practical medicine which the progress of the ⁵

sciences rendered possible, aud which was reserved to be the
special glory of the next . But 3 definite and brilliant
service was rendered to e progress of medicine b the
scholars of the Renaissance, among whom no nas-ne is tter
entitled to be held in grateful remembranee than that of
Thomas Linacre.

. It would be out of place here to enter into any genera!
estimate of the value of Galen’s writings. They are of im«
mense bulk, and few persons in modern times can claim to
have done more than dip into them. But this massivensss and
bulk were perhaps even among the features which caused his
works to be held in such high estimation. They formed a vast
encyclopaedia in which ‘all the ancient medical lore was com⁴
prised. A very large pan of the works even of Hippocrates
may be said to be contained in Galen, and many older
