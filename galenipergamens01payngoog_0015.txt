The Publishers are desirous os gaining information about the
printer, John Siberch, before 1521, when he commenced to print in

Cambridge, and aster 1522 when he discontinued prinn'ng there. Ι

Haben suggests that he may be the John Sibert, who -was printing
at Lyons in 1498, and mentions a book os that date being in the
Cambridge University Lihmy. But this book, Henrici Bouhic Dis>
tinctiones super libros quinque Decretalium, consists os two large
folia volumes, snd' the printer cans himself ’ΜΨ-τίεν johann&
§ibatis both os which sam make it unreasonable tu identify him
with the plain johannes Siberch who printed litu: books at Cnmbridge
so many years asterwards. ι
